Artists' Albums "Play All" button doesnt work

Swipe to next song - should only go to next song, I dont like the multiple scroll on long swipe

Should be able to click on artist name on now playing to go to artist
Should be able to click on album name on now playing to go to album
Should be able to click on song name on now playing to go to album containing it

Dont need skip buttons on now playing

Easier to get to queue from now playing - shouldn't have to click extra settings menu
